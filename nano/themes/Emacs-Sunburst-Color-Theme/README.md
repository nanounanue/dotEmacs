# Emacs 'Sunburst' color theme #

The following theme was created by someone identifying themselves as 'dngpng'
in the source code.  References to it can be found [here](http://pdeng.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/my-emacs-color-theme/).
The source can be found [here](http://p3n9.kilu.de/color-theme-sunburst.el).
The author originally created it to resemble the Textmate 'Sunburst' theme, but
instead called it 'color-theme-tm'.  I have renamed it 'color-theme-sunburst'

 It also had support for erc, nxm-mode, and mmm.

I am versioning it, since I will be adding support for other modes, and emacs tools
(such as jabber.el).  And I hope it will encourage others to add to it too.

## Support Modes
In its original form, this theme it contained all basic emacs faces (back-ground-color,
 border-color, etc.).

It also supports the following modes:

* nxml
* erc
* jabber.el
* magit


## Copyright ##

Since I didn't originally create this color-theme, I assert no copyright about the code
that I add to it.
